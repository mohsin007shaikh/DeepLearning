    "Welcome to the PyTorch version of the data loading lab! You have explored the core concept of sequential loading by manually handling file paths and opening images one by one. This memory-efficient method is the foundation for how all modern deep learning frameworks handle large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will implement the **PyTorch** utilities for the same. You will discover PyTorch's modular approach, which separates *data representation* from *data iteration*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Custom `Dataset` Class:** You'll build our own dataset class from scratch by inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. This gives you full control and a deep understanding of the data pipeline.\n",
    "2.  **In-built `ImageFolder` Utility:** You'll use the convenient `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` class, which automatically handles data from a standard directory structure.\n",
    "3.  **The `DataLoader`:** You'll wrap both of our datasets in a `DataLoader`, PyTorch's engine for efficient batching, shuffling, and parallelized data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll compare these methods to understand why this modular design is so powerful.\n"

It's the most convenient way to load image datasets organized in folders, where each subfolder represents a different class.\n",

    "**ImageFolder** acts as a quick bridge between raw image files and PyTorch models. You can point the `root` argument at the top-level dataset folder, and the class automatically walks through every subfolder, using each subfolder’s name as a label. You can attach a `transform pipeline` with common choices including `transforms.Resize`, `transforms.CenterCrop`, `transforms.ToTensor`, and `transforms.Normalize` to pre-process every image on the fly. Calling `len(dataset)` reveals total images, while indexing `dataset[i]` returns an `(image, label)` pair. You can then combine it with `DataLoader` to batch, shuffle, and parallel-load data effortlessly.\n",

    "This lab has demonstrated the power and elegance of PyTorch's data loading API. The key takeaway is the **separation of concerns**:\n",
    "- The `Dataset` class defines *what* the data is and *how to get a single item*.\n",
    "- The `DataLoader` class defines *how to iterate over* the data, handling batching, shuffling, and performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "While building a custom `Dataset` is an excellent way to understand the underlying mechanics and is necessary for complex scenarios, `ImageFolder` provides a simple and robust solution for the vast majority of image classification problems. In either case, the `DataLoader` is the essential tool that makes the entire pipeline efficient and ready for training a deep learning model.\n",
